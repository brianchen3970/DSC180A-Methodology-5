Graph ML for Chip Profiling
1. Graph Neural Networks
2. Using graph machine learning on a netlist to determine how congested certain parts of the chip are, or maybe timing issues with the chip. 
3. Our Quarter 1 Project mostly consists of simple graph algorithms and graph machine learning methods, so I would want to explore more sophisticated techniques when doing my Quarter 2 Project.
4. In particular, we recently learned about augmenting our data to bring more variety and complexity, so I think that would be an interesting approach to explore if we had sufficient time to do so.
